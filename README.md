# Android Project 1 - Wordle Lab

Submitted by: Christopher Madrigal

Wordle Lab is an android app that recreates a simple version of the popular word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). 

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **User has 3 chances to guess a random 4 letter word**
- [X] **After 3 guesses, user should no longer be able to submit another guess**
- [X] **After each guess, user sees the "correctness" of the guess**
- [X] **After all guesses are taken, user can see the target word displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can toggle betweeen different word lists
- [ ] User can see the 'correctness' of their guess through colors on the word 
- [ ] User sees a visual change after guessing the correct word
- [X] User can tap a 'Reset' button to get a new word and clear previous guesses
- [ ] User will get an error message if they input an invalid guess
- [ ] User can see a 'streak' record of how many words they've guessed correctly.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

- I actually was only able to have a reset button that cleared the previous guesses, but it doesn't end up starting a new game with a new word. Something to work on for the future of this application.
- The user isn't allowed to make any more guesses after they have made 3 because it switches to a reset button which doesn't allow any further guessing no matter whether they input something or not.
